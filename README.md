TimeProgressExtension
=====================

DashClock Extension which displays the progress between two times, every day.

My original intention was to use this to visualize the amount of time passed in my work shift. Initially, I had planned to make this an Android widget, but decided on a DashClock Extension since DashClock is always staring me in the face on my home screen.

The progress of the time is illustrated with a crude ASCII representation due to DashClock's restrictions, but I think it works pretty well.

Enjoy.
